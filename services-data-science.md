  service1:
    head: Discovery
    img: /assets/cap-icon1.png
    txt: Our approach begins with defining the problem being solved. It is followed by understanding the unique requirements, analyzing the data, and defining future goals to make recommendations for tools, technology, and architecture. 
  service2:
    head: Proof of concept
    img: /assets/cap-icon2.png
    txt: Building small scale system to validate the viability of the solution.
  service3:
    head: Improvement
    img: /assets/cap-icon3.png
    txt: Continuously improve the solution by rapid iterations and automatically train the solution to become more efficient and enhance the quality of data insights.
  service4:
    head: Detect Bias
    img: /assets/cap-icon4.png
    txt: Find any bias in the system and remove them using a mix of pre-processing, training, and post-processing methods.
  service5:
    head: Production
    img: /assets/cap-icon4.png
    txt: Put the trained data model into production and continuously improve it by retraining to unlock the predictive power of the model

  experience1:
    head: Machine Learning
    text: Whether youâ€™re looking to anticipate future industry trends or understand the semantics of the written word, Machine Learning/Ai is one of the most powerful tools we can put at your disposal. Our focus on natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and predictive analytics allow you to automate decision-making and pattern recognition processes trained from your data sets or ones carefully selected by us.
  experience2:
    head: Data Pipelines
    text: When it comes to transferring huge volumes of information quickly, powerful large-scale data processing is vital. Utilizing open-source, lightning fast, reactive and distributed cluster computing frameworks (such as Spark, MapReduce, Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, Casandra, ElasticSearch, and Akka) we can create a data pipeline tailored to the specific needs of your project. 
  experience3:  
    head: Bioinformatics
    text: Our expert team of bioinformaticians, statisticians, molecular biologists, computer scientists, and scientific programmers provide in-depth bioinformatics analysis to provide high-quality, publication-ready genomics and proteomics data. We are well versed in Next Generation Sequence data management and analysis, Genotyping and SNP data analysis, Microarray data analysis and tools, structural and functional genomics, and statistical and bio-mathematical modeling. 
  experience4: 
    head: Kubeflow
    text: Putting a trained model in production without having a pipeline to continuously retrain the model is bound to make that model outdated as time progresses. Our engineers build a data science pipeline using Kubeflow to ensure the data pre-processing, parameter tuning, and model training steps are part of the CI/CD pipeline and can leverage the multi-step workflow model
