services:
  service1:
    head: Developer Focused
    img: /assets/Developer_Focused.svg
    txt: Our DevSecOps pipelines are focused on the productivity of the Developers while at the same time ensuring the security is ensured. As developers embrace cloud native platforms such as Kubernetes, our team builds pipelines that provide the developers a direct view into the security so that security isn’t an after-thought.
  service2:
    head: Zero Trust
    img: /assets/Zero_trust.svg
    txt: Our team utilizes Istio to enable a zero trust model where all communications are encrypted between microservices, centrally authorized, and continually validated against a service mesh policy. Our team achieves this by pushing a centralized policy configuration into the Envoy sidecar proxies for each pod.
  service3:
    head: Pipeline Driven
    img: /assets/Pipeline_Driven.svg
    txt: We believe in a cloud native environment most things should be automated. Whether that’d be finding CVEs at the time of building container images, static/dynamic code analysis, runtime security, testing, or deploying, our team prepares pipelines that trigger all these things at the time of merge into master branch
  service4:
    head: Continuous Monitoring
    img: /assets/Continuous_Monitoring.svg
    txt: Receiving Authority To Operate (ATO) shouldn’t be one all and be all for the solution. Rather than spending man hours to periodically manually going through the compliance of the security controls, our team believes in continuous monitoring that is triggered at the time of any change to the system.
  service5:
    head: Immutable
    img: /assets/immutability.svg
    txt: Null Pointer Exceptions and Buffer Overflows are a thing of the past when using Immutable structures and pattern matching. At the core of our teams approach to immutability is automation. We automate every part of the deployment down to the lowest level so that any change in a deployed system requires deploying a new system.
  service6:
    head: GitOps
    img: /assets/gitops.svg
    txt: Our team maintains the codebase of the infrastructure in Git so that the entire infrastructure can be re-deployed from the code with the least amount of human intervention. GitOps is the basis for our team to use automated monitoring to alert our engineers when the configuration running in our cloud native environment doesn’t match the configuration in code.
experiences:
  experience1:
    head: Kubernetes
    text: The only thing more important than building a good product efficiently, is launching a stable and secure product quickly. The Kubernetes (K8s) open-source system allows us to do just that, utilizing it’s revolutionary capacity to design, deploy and manage cluster based containers systems, our team utilizes K8s Admission Control, and RBAC to ensure the public facing clusters are secure.
  experience2:
    head: Service Mesh
    text: Our team uses both Edge Routing (using Ambassador - Envoy) and Ingress (using Istio - Envoy) to secure network communication down to the pod level. Using Istio as a sidecar, our team provides authentication, observability, relillience, and traffic management.
  experience3:  
    head: Falco
    text: Our team is involved with the open source Falco project for container native runtime security. Working at the most basic layer, the kernel, our team can detect anomalous activity at both application and infrastructure level.
